To create Figures 7,8 run the following two R scripts in order from this directory.

```
Rscript run_normal_normal_sim.R
Rscript run_normal_normal_make_plots.R

The plots will then be located in results/normal_normal/. Note that run_normal_normal_sim.R may take a few hours to run.

# Appendix B (Coefficient of Variation)

To create Figure 9 run the following two R scripts in order from this directory.

```
Rscript run_coef_var_mcmc.R
Rscript run_coef_var_make_plots.R
```
The plots will then be located in results/coef_var/. Note that run_coef_var_mcmc.R may take a few hours to run.
